I want to add you to the "$venture" Venture on Misthos, a multisig bitcoin wallet to collaboratively handle our income and payouts.

Before I can send you the invite, please sign into $webDomain to expose your public key for data encryption (this will happen automatically when you sign in). Let me know when youâ€™ve done so, and I can send you the Venture invite link.
